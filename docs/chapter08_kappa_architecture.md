### ⚡ **Kappa Architecture**

- **Overview**: Kappa Architecture is a data processing framework designed to handle real-time data streams using a single, unified processing path. It was introduced by **Jay Kreps**, one of the co-creators of Apache Kafka, as a simplification of the Lambda Architecture. citeturn0search3

- **Key Features**:
  - **Stream-First Processing**: All data is treated as a real-time stream, eliminating the need for separate batch processing layers. citeturn0search0
  - **Simplified Architecture**: By utilizing a single processing system, Kappa Architecture reduces complexity and maintenance overhead compared to architectures that separate batch and stream processing. citeturn0search6
  - **Scalability**: Designed to handle large volumes of data in real-time, making it suitable for applications requiring immediate insights. citeturn0search10

- **Use Cases**:
  - **Real-Time Analytics**: Applications that require immediate data processing and analysis, such as monitoring systems and recommendation engines. citeturn0search14
  - **Event-Driven Architectures**: Systems that react to events as they occur, benefiting from the low-latency processing capabilities of Kappa Architecture. citeturn0search4
