### **AWS Lakehouse Architecture: Components and Services**  

* Reference 1 : [Building Lakehouse on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/build-a-lake-house-architecture-on-aws/)
* Reference 2 : [AWS Lakehouse](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/harness-the-power-of-your-data-with-aws-analytics/)

The **AWS Lakehouse** architecture unifies the scalability of **data lakes** with the performance of **data warehouses**, enabling a **flexible**, **scalable**, and **cost-effective** approach to modern data management. This architecture is built around a central **Amazon S3** data lake and utilizes **purpose-built AWS services** for diverse data processing and analytics needs. Here’s a breakdown of the **core layers** and the corresponding AWS services:

---

### **1. Data Ingestion Layer**  
This layer is responsible for **collecting and importing** data from various structured, semi-structured, and unstructured sources in **real-time** or **batch** mode.

✅ **AWS Services:**  
- **Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose** – For **real-time streaming** data ingestion.  
- **AWS Glue** – For **batch ingestion** and **Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)**.  
- **AWS DataSync** – For **automated transfer** of data from on-premises to the cloud.  
- **Amazon AppFlow** – For **SaaS** application data integration.

---

### **2. Data Storage Layer**  
This layer provides **scalable**, **durable**, and **cost-efficient** storage for **raw** and **processed** data across multiple formats (e.g., Parquet, ORC, JSON, CSV).

✅ **AWS Services:**  
- **Amazon S3** – The **core** of the AWS Lakehouse, providing **infinite** storage for **all data types** (structured, semi-structured, unstructured).  
- **Amazon Redshift** – For **structured** data that requires **fast** SQL-based analytics.  
- **AWS Lake Formation** – For creating and managing **secure** data lakes using **metadata catalogs**.

---

### **3. Data Processing Layer**  
This layer handles **data transformation**, **enrichment**, and **advanced analytics** using a mix of **batch**, **stream**, and **real-time** engines.

✅ **AWS Services:**  
- **AWS Glue** – For **serverless ETL**, **schema discovery**, and **data preparation**.  
- **Amazon EMR** – For **big data** processing using frameworks like **Apache Spark**, **Hadoop**, and **Presto**.  
- **Amazon Athena** – For **serverless SQL** querying directly on data stored in **S3**.  
- **AWS Lambda** – For **serverless** event-driven data transformations.  
- **Amazon SageMaker** – For **machine learning** (model training, inference, and deployment).

---

### **4. Data Governance and Security Layer**  
This layer ensures **data security**, **access control**, and **compliance** across the AWS Lakehouse through **centralized** governance.

✅ **AWS Services:**  
- **AWS Lake Formation** – For **fine-grained access control**, **data cataloging**, and **auditing**.  
- **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** – For **role-based** and **resource-based** access policies.  
- **Amazon Macie** – For **automated** sensitive data detection and protection.  
- **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)** – For **data encryption** at rest and in transit.

---

### **5. Data Consumption Layer**  
This layer supports **querying**, **visualization**, and **downstream applications** using the right AWS service based on the **use case**.

✅ **AWS Services:**  
- **Amazon Redshift** – For **OLAP workloads**, complex **SQL queries**, and **BI** reporting.  
- **Amazon Athena** – For **ad-hoc** and **interactive** queries on **raw** data in S3.  
- **Amazon QuickSight** – For **data visualization**, **dashboards**, and **business intelligence**.  
- **Amazon SageMaker** – For **ML model** deployment and inference on **structured** and **unstructured** data.  
- **AWS Glue Data Catalog** – For **metadata management** and **cross-service** discovery.

### **6: Sagemaker Lakehouse**
This is WORK IN PROGRESS since its released recently. From Lakehouse aspect, it provides Access data across S3, Glue Data Catalog, Redshift. But i have several open questions on how its integrated with Glue Catalog, Lakeformation, Redshift, Athena etc..
